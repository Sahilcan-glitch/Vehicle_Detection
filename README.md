# Vehicle Detection

This project uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for detecting vehicles in images. The model is trained using custom data and can classify vehicles with high accuracy. The application allows users to upload images and get real-time vehicle detection results.

## Features

- **Vehicle Detection**: Upload an image and detect vehicles using the YOLO model.
- **Streamlit Application**: The model is hosted in a Streamlit web app for easy user interaction.
  
## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv5 / YOLOv8**: The object detection model used in this project.
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used for model training and inference.
- **Streamlit**: Used for building and deploying the interactive web app.

## Live Demo
